		 * 		to be done in week days
		 
		I want to calculate the area of the different shapes 
		- square, rectangle, circle

		1. create 4 constructors - 
			default + three constructors for the shapes (using constructor overloading)
		
		2. create 3 methods for 
			(square, rectangle, circle) display which will 
			display the value of the area calculated)
		
		3. calculate the area of the rhombus and triangle 
			using the method overloading concept
