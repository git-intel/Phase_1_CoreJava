 * (1)
 * 		assignment 1: (function overloading) - session 2
		
		Note **: create function name as "calculate"
		
		create three functions in a class
		
		1) create method of return type int
		
		   - add two numbers
		
		2) one of return type float
		
		  to calculate the area of the circle
		
		3) one of return type int
		
		   area of the rectangle
		
		from Virendra . to All Participan

 * (2)
		Assignment 2:(method + constructors)
		 * 		to be done in week days
		 
		I want to calculate the area of the different shapes 
		- square, rectangle, circle

		1. create 4 constructors - 
			default + three constructors for the shapes (using constructor overloading)
		
		2. create 3 methods for 
			(square, rectangle, circle) display which will 
			display the value of the area calculated)
		
		3. calculate the area of the rhombus and triangle 
			using the method overloading concept
			
//		>>>assignment.constructor.shapes.area	
* (3)
		Assignment 3: create the 4 student objects with name s1,s2,s3,s4
			
		declare the class member variables with String name, int age, 
		section(char type), gender (char type), and
		three int subject marks (subject1, subject 2, subject 3).
			
		Calculate the total marks and percentage obtained by every student
		(total= subject 1 + subject 2+ subject 3) by
		passing the values from the parameterized constructor.
		and for s2 and s3 students we will not pass subject 1 marks 
		so it is 0 so don't pass it in constructor.	
		
//		>>>assignment.constructor.overloading

 * (4) 
 * 		Assignment 4:
		String t= "Delhi";  
		String o = "Mumbai";
		String k= "delhi";  
		String y= new String ("Mumbai");  
		String l= new String ("delhi"); 
		String p = new String("Hello"); 
		
		equals and ==
		(1) o with l
		(2) y with p
		(3) t with o
		(4) k with y
		(5) p with y
