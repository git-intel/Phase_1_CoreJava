assignment 1: (function overloading)

Note **: create function name as "calculate"
create three functions in a class
1) create method of return type int
   - add two numbers

2) one of return type float
  to calculate the area of the circle

3) one of return type int 
   area of the rectangle



Assignment 2:(method + constructors)
i want to calculate the area of the different shapes - square, rectangle, circle
1. create 4 constructors - default + three consutrctors for the shapes (using constructor overloading)
2. create 3 methods for (square, rectangle, circle) display which will display the value of the area calculated
3. calcuate the area of the rhombus and triangle using the method overaloding concept 




Assignment 3: create the 4 student objects with name s1,s2,s3,s4
- declare the class member variables with String name, int age, section(char type), gender (char type), and three int subject marks (subject1, subject 2, subject 3). 

Calcuate the total marks and percentage obtained by every student (total= subject 1 + subject 2+ subject 3) by passing the values from the parameterized constructor. and for s2 and s3 stduents we will not pass subject 1 marks so it is 0 so dont pass it in constructor.



Assignment 4:
We have to calculate the percentage of marks obtained in three subjects (each out of 100) by student A and in four subjects (each out of 100) by student B. Create an abstract class 'Marks' with an abstract method 'getPercentage'. It is inherited by two other classes 'A' and 'B' each having a method with the same name which returns the percentage of the students. The constructor of student A takes the marks in three subjects as its parameters and the marks in four subjects as its parameters for student B. Create an object for eac of the two classes and print the percentage of marks for both the students.
